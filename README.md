# Code for Inverse Problems Project Course

## Dependencies:
1. [ASTRA Toolbox](https://github.com/astra-toolbox/astra-toolbox) for Filtered Backprojection and for building the forward operator.
2. [TVReg](https://github.com/jakobsj/TVReg) for Total Variation regularization.

## Basic Usage:
See example\_01.m for basic usage so far. You may have to open the tomographyProject.prj folder to get MATLAB to add all the appropriate folders to the path.

Note that all of the full-size images are not tracked in this repo, to keep the size manageable. But the data we collected should go in the corresponding folders in /data/input. The binned images have been added to the repo, since they were less than a GB all together.
